Safety and diversity - We aim to create a contactless ATM facility, and are using computer vision for recognizing the user gestures. This can help us reduce the risk of getting infected and thus act as a safety measure too. The need to go to the banks with a crowd will also reduce. It is cost effective as and user friendly, but yet can prove to be a boon for the general public
